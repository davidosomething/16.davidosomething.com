<p>So I&#8217;m officially a jQuery plugin author now. I wrote a plugin, jQuery Wunderkind that can create a CSS imagemap for you with hover effects (the special thing is the hover effect). There&#8217;s lots of room for improvement, but there aren&#8217;t many imagemap plugins to choose from so it&#8217;s worth something I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>I made this plugin as a challenge to myself, after working on a client website that has a similar feature (see the larger flash module on thetruth.com). With this plugin it&#8217;s easy to recreate the entire flash module without flash.</p>
<p>Get the plugin and more details here:<br />
