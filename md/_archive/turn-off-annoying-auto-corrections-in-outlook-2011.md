<p>Outlook 2011 has this annoying feature where it italicizes words surrounded by underscores. For instance, if you were to type <kbd>_test_</kbd>, Outlook would change this to <em>test</em>, sans underscores. As a developer this is VERY annoying.</p>
<p>To turn it off, go to Outlook&#8217;s preferences pane and go to the AutoCorrect panel. The outdated, typewriter-era features are in the AutoFormat tab. If you&#8217;re like me and never make mistakes, you might as well turn off everything in the AutoCorrect section.</p>
