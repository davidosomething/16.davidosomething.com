<p>Allston is no place for a non-college student to live. Roxbury isn&#8217;t so great either. In an effort to get off of the college-populated and super slow B-Line of the MBTA, I&#8217;ve been looking for new apartments near Coolidge Corner. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been picking up through this experience:</p>
<h3>Searching for results? Let them search for you!</h3>
<p>The only sites worth checking out are specific Realtor sites. Use their search engines if you are feeling ambitious, because they will turn up results not in Craigslist.</p>
<p>For all other searches, such as Craigslist and Apartments.com, use <a href="http://www.padmapper.com/">padmapper</a> to do your searching. After filtering out the results you want, you can subscribe to a search via e-mail, so all new results will be e-mailed to you! Resize your browser to limit it to a specific area, like so:<br />
<a href="http://davidosomething.com/content/uploads/padmapper.png"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="http://davidosomething.com/content/uploads/padmapper-485x400.png" alt="" title="Filtered and Resized padmapper search" width="485" height="400" class="lazy lazy-hidden aligncenter size-medium wp-image-276" /><noscript><img src="http://davidosomething.com/content/uploads/padmapper-485x400.png" alt="" title="Filtered and Resized padmapper search" width="485" height="400" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-276" /></noscript></a><br />
I&#8217;ve got a daily subscription of apartments under $800 per room that I follow up on if I see any I like. The searches come to me, instead of hunting and pecking through Craigslists&#8217; mess. There are other similar services, but from personal experience padmapper has the most results for Boston.<br />

<h3>One e-mail</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve also got a standard e-mail with criteria I&#8217;m looking for. This was devised in collaboration with my girlfriend, and is based on living in two different parts of Boston (or outside Boston, as it is). The e-mail is something like this (not exactly):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi,</p>
<p>I found your posting on Craigslist: http://url_to_posting/ and would like to schedule a viewing of this apartment on XXXday X:xx PM. Please let me know if you are available.</p>
<p>Also, I am searching for similar units matching the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available XXXXXX 1st, 2010</li>
<li>Three or four bedrooms</li>
<li>Maximum rent of $XXXX (or $XXX per room)</li>
<li>Kitchen large enough for two or three people to fit comfortably</li>
<li>Steps away (no more than two blocks) from the T</li>
<li>etc.
</ul>
<p>You can reach me at this e-mail address, or by phone at xxx-xxx-xxxx.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you,<br />
me.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This template gets modified just slightly for each Realtor, and saves everyone time in terms of finding other properties.</p>
<h3>Walk-ins</h3>
<p>Allston is full of Realtors, so walk-ins are not inconvenient. They have yielded some nice hidden results as well, since not all Realtors post their listings online.</p>
<h3>Meeting the Realtor</h3>
<p>Keep the list of criteria at hand and review the properties you are going to see first. Maybe you can rule out units based on location (10 minute walk to the train? No thanks!), actual price (&#8220;It&#8217;s just a little out of your range&#8230;&#8221; so don&#8217;t waste my time!), or description (e.g. a 4th floor with no moving elevator? No thanks!).</p>
<h3>Visiting the Apartment</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a checklist of things to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully you scheduled a daytime visit to get maximum lighting, but sometimes it&#8217;s not possible.</li>
<li>You have a camera right? It takes videos as well, right? Take lots photos and videos! Not just of the rooms, but of the entrance way, the distance to the train, and the stairs leading in.</li>
<li>How was the walk in? Are the stairs super windy and impossible to carry a bed and couch through?</li>
<li>Who lives upstairs, downstairs, and who is in the neighboring units (party animals)?</li>
<li>Did the Realtor fumble the keys (the lock is worn)? Is the door rickety?</li>
<li>Is it just you, or is it really hot/cold in there? Can the temp. be adjusted?</li>
<li>How thin are the walls? How far apart are the rooms from each other?</li>
<li>Do all the light switches work? This can be fixed before you move in as well.</li>
<li>Are the floors coming up? Can they be fixed before you move in?</li>
<li>Do the kitchen cabinets open and close easily? Can they be fixed?</li>
<li>Do all the fires work on the oven range?</li>
<li>Bathroom(s) small? Do you practically have to sit side saddle on the toilet? (I do in Allston!) Full bath? Shower water pressure?</li>
<li>Do the room doors lock?</li>
<li>What do the room windows overlook? (Garbage dumpsters are BAD. It means noise in the morning!)</li>
<li>Do the windows lock? Are they crappy? How easy is it to put in blinds?</li>
<li>Is there a safe place to lock your bike/scooter? Parking area? How far is it REALLY to the train?</li>
<li>Where&#8217;s the laundry facility? And where does garbage go?</li>
<li>Would the landlord drop/lower the fee if you do some repairs? (Only if you went through a broker and the fee isn&#8217;t fully covered).</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck if you&#8217;re looking, too!</p>
<p>note: Didn&#8217;t realize Realtor was a trademark, not a common word. The noun &#8220;agent&#8221; or &#8220;broker&#8221; can be used instead.</p>
