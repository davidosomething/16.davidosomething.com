This is an experiment.

What I've done here is documented some JS using [JSDoc], and then using
[jsdoc-to-markdown] (via its official [gulp plugin]), run the parsed JSDoc
through Handlebars templates to create frontmatter-loaded markdown files.

Those markdown files are then run through [metalsmith] and processed in
handlebars (again) into html using my existing website structure.

### For the future

It would probably be better to bypass [jsdoc-to-markdown] and just use
[jsdoc-parse]. Then just add the objects directly to metalsmith's `files`
object (with extended data to match the object structure). This would also give
me more control over the output formatting, instead of using the formatting
generated by [jsdoc-to-markdown].
