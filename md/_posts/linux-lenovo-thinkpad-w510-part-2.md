<p>I&#8217;m leaving Linux Mint 16 behind. The RC for Linux Mint 17 is out so maybe that will fix some things, but the main problem I&#8217;ve had is with installing packages. Apt just doesn&#8217;t cut it, especially when I think back to when I was using ArchLinux. So I&#8217;m going back to Arch and the next post will be about that.</p>
<p>Apt&#8217;s greatest downfall is that as you add PPAs and when you start needing multiple architectures, the dependency chain breaks and is almost impossible to fix.</p>
<h3>Hardware Upgrades</h3>
<p>Since I got the laptop, I&#8217;ve made some upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve upgraded the RAM to 16GB.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve completely replaced the keyboard with a new one since I got a refurb. The springy feeling is much better now.</li>
<li>I took apart the casing and replaced the laptop display with a FHD one, 1920&#215;1080. <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Upgrading+the+Lenovo+ThinkPad+T520+Display/9763" target="_blank">This guide helped.</a></li>
<li>I replaced the optical drive with a HDD caddy from Lenovo and put a second 240GB SSD in there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who says a laptop isn&#8217;t upgradable? The screen in particular was super easy and worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Display Calibration</h3>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve yet to figure out is how to use the display calibrator. The ThinkPad comes with a Huey Pro in the palm rest that is supposed to detect the colors and calibrate the screen when the lid is closed. I&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://dispcalgui.hoech.net/" target="_blank">DispCalGui</a> but it goes straight to a gray screen and I&#8217;m pretty sure the screen is turning off when I close the lid. The Huey Pro is a detected device, though, so I&#8217;ll keep looking into it.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ThinkVantage button can be mapped using the program <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tpb" target="_blank">tpb</a>. I&#8217;m mapping it to open a gnome-terminal. Can&#8217;t think of anything else I&#8217;d use it for.</p>
