<p>So I just got back from the Washington, DC iteration of An Event Apart. I feel that if you follow all the speakers&#8217; blogs and read Smashing Magazine&#8217;s content (or nontent, as it is), they&#8217;re really just saying the same thing. The real experience is paying to see these pioneers and policy-makers speak live and network with them (they are easily approachable at the conference or at the after parties). </p>
<p>The key message this year has been to <em>stop trying to make your site look the same in every browser</em>. You can approach this either through <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement/">Progressive Enhancement</a> or graceful degradation (neither of which are new topics).<br />
Other messages included:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS3 and HTML5 are already usable if you design with progressive enhancement in mind</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">Mobile-first design</a> is a great process to address design</li>
<li>A slew of CSS3 animation and style demos to show how easy it is to spice up a website</li>
</ul>
<p>An Event Apart&#8217;s audience seemed to be made up of mostly designers and developers, which I don&#8217;t think is the right crowd since the speakers end up preaching to the choir. <strong>The audience should be made up of clients&mdash;that is, anyone who wants a website.</strong> If you want or have a website, this is where you would go to find out what you should be getting. Clients (i.e., corporations with people who think they know a thing or two about &#8220;the internets&#8221; and &#8220;the twitter&#8221; and how &#8220;they need a facebook page&#8221;) are the ones asking for useless and backwards things like IE6 and 7 compatibility. That&#8217;s like asking for AC on a horse and carriage.</p>
