JavaScript/[jQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility) and CSS
compatibility is finally at a decent state amongst major browsers (IE and ACID3
notwithstanding). At least, similar/the same DOM manipulation behavior can be
reproduced across those browsers. Not only that, but the JavaScript rendering
speed of engines other than Trident (IE’s) is [quite
fast](http://lifehacker.com/5457242/browser-speed-tests-firefox-36-chrome-4-opera-105-and-extensions).
With these developments, it is actually possible to
[create](http://gamequery.onaluf.org/)
[playable](http://jonraasch.com/blog/jquery-video-game-remake-tc-surf-designs)
games (really, check those links out!).

### The Demo

In about 4 hours I’ve created a demo RPG here using jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, and
the [Javascript jQuery Hotkeys Plugin](http://code.google.com/p/js-hotkeys/).
I’m surprised no one has created a complete, working one yet, as tile-based RPGs
are much easier to make than action games with collision detection.

If anyone is interested, I might continue building this, adding in turn-based
menu battles (oh boy!), a shop system, and AJAX saving and loading with an HTML5
backend. **Leave a comment!**

### Outro

Not that I’m against Flash (looking at you, Apple), but JavaScript is much
easier to learn and there is much potential in using it for things other than
special effects and Web Applications. We’ve already recreated all the basic
elements used in the Nintendo games of yore using CSS and jQuery; e.g., sprite
animation (with many techniques) and
[parallax](http://stephband.info/jparallax/)
[scrolling](http://dev.jonraasch.com/scrolling-parallax/examples/scrolling-parallax).
Combined with the super fance sliding, fading, easing, and opacity animations we
are already afforded, the browser is a feature rich playground for game
developers. Hopefully we’ll see more techniques emerge, and with them more
games. I am looking forward to jQuery being the new QBASIC.
