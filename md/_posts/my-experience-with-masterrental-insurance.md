<p>MasterRental is a service provided by MasterCard when you rent a vehicle and pay for all rental related expenses with your MasterCard. It serves as a supplemental insurance if you are already insured by another plan (i.e., it may cover things your car insurance, the primary insurance, did now). If you aren&#8217;t, MasterRental will serve as your primary insurance (that&#8217;s what I did).</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>There are specific conditions you must follow in order to qualify for MasterRental, so make sure you check the terms and conditions that came with your card. They should be similar (likely identical) to <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/us/personal/en/cardholderservices/guidetobenefits/pdf/11660_rent_save_2006.pdf">the MasterRental terms on the MasterCard site</a>, but check with your card provider to be sure. The benefits pamphlet is actually a really great read and may enlighten you to the other benefits of using a credit card (e.g., free extended warranties and refunds for things that the store may not accept).</p>
<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<ol>
<li>Report accident to rental company and police within 24 hours</li>
<li>File insurance claim within 30 days of the incident</li>
<li>Submit required documentation within 180 days of the incident</li>
</ol>

<h3>My Circumstances</h3>
<p>I rented a car with Avis using my HSBC MasterCard, and declined the Collision/Damage Waiver (<abbr title="Collision/Damage Waiver">CDW</abbr>). Well, after some driving on the open road, I ended up in a guardrail (I won&#8217;t go into the details of that). Thankfully, there were no other cars involved in the accident.</p>
<h4>Documents received:</h4>
<ol>
<li>All rental forms (receipt, rental agreement)</li>
<li>Rental car insurance information (Avis&#8217; insurance, in glove compartment)</li>
<li>Rental car registration (also in glove compartment)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Accident Actions</h3>
<p>Some passer-bys called the police for me and came by to see if everything was alright (nice people). After the traffic officer came, we all had a chat about the situation and the people left. An accident report was written up and I was given a summary (in MA you have to request the report by mailing a request and processing fee to a police station). The officer called the local towing facility and soon I was sitting in the waiting room there, with my car in the lot. I had to fill out forms for the towing station. Rather than have the towing station tow the car back to Avis, I called Avis&#8217; roadside assistance line (which took FOREVER and a million call transfers). This call constituted a report of the accident on Avis&#8217; side. I payed the release fee for the towing facility. Unfortunately, the accident happened after 5pm on Friday, so the car couldn&#8217;t be towed until Monday. A friend picked me up from the towing facility.</p>
<h4>Documents received:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Accident report summary</li>
<li>Towing facility receipt</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rental and Report Charge</h3>
<p>On Monday, I went to the Avis facility to check on the status of the car. The car was towed on Monday and arrived at the Avis repair facility. Because it took all weekend, the rental contract wasn&#8217;t closed until Avis received the car again. I was charged for the full term of the rental (I only rented it for the weekend anyway). This showed up on my credit card activity online, and in my statement at the end of the month. I also sent in a check and request for the official police accident report to be sent to MasterCard.</p>
<h4>Documents received:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Credit card statement showing rental charges (end of month)</li>
<li>Police report (sent to MasterCard)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Filing the Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>I called 1-800-MC-ASSIST the Monday after the accident. Within a week I received a packet with details and the required forms from MasterCard (sent to my credit card billing address!) I filled out the forms and sent them out with a copy of my Driver&#8217;s License and copies of all of the documents I received above.<br />
An Avis representative called me within a week for a follow-up about the accident and for information about my insurance (MasterRental). They initiated the contact with MasterCard and supplied their documentation.</p>
<h3>Checking the Claim Status and Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>I was able to check the status of my claim and see what documents they had and still needed at any given time by going to their claim website: <a href="http://www.yourclaimstatus.com/">http://www.yourclaimstatus.com/</a>. The entire ordeal was resolved within four months (~120 days. The final deadline was 180 days). Overall this was an ordeal I hope to never repeat again. If it did happen, I would call MasterCard&#8217;s roadside assistance for the towing service, since they cover towing. It won&#8217;t happen because I was able to get a corporate <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">ZipCar</a> membership through my employer, and accident-related issues are <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/cities?return_url=/how/faqs/one-faq%3ffaq_number%3d28">handled by ZipCar</a> entirely (the car and authorized driver are covered through Liberty Mutual).</p>
