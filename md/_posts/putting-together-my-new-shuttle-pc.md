Feeling a bit prodigious, I bought a Shuttle PC the other day (SH55). It totally
looks like a toaster, but it’s cool. It’s going to be an always-on HTPC for the
living room.

I am completely out of the consumer PC hardware loop and ended up getting the
i7-860 (1156) instead of an i5. The major, major difference for these two would
be the availability of integrated graphics on the i5, vs two extra cores on the
i7. Wish I had gotten the i5, since then I would be able to play with the PC
immediately using the integrated graphics.

As it is now, I’m waiting for an EVGA GeForce GT 240 video card. The DirectX 11
compatible cards are too expensive for now. Also, it’s a single slot card that
is suitable for the Shuttle stock 300W power supply, so it should be quiet and
cool compared to some of the monstrosities out there. This card is just enough
since the PC is going to be using the TV as its monitor, with a native 1920
x 1200 resolution.

I got two sticks of 4GB G.Skill Ripjaws DDR3 1333, total of 8GB. Combined with
the graphics card, this machine should be able to run Photoshop CS5 swimmingly
as well. In the end its way better than any machine I have now. I’m using the
HDD and optical drive from my old PC. The harddrive uses SATA revision 1, so it
will probably be the biggest bottleneck for the system.

There’s a lot of room for upgrade in the system: new GFX card (maybe a full size
one if I change the power supply), two more DIMM slots, and another 3.5 inch HDD
(hello SSD!), so this machine should be good for many years.
