I've just [published on npm][npm], my gulp plugin to lint markdown files using
[remark] and [remark-lint]. It's fully functional right now, and you can
install it from npm to start using it in your gulpfile:

```
npm install --save-dev gulp-remark-lint-dko
```

I am planning to add more features, which you can follow in the [README] or
help contribute with a pull request.

- [gulp-remark-lint-dko on GitHub][github]
- [gulp-remark-lint-dko on npmjs.com][npm]

Here's a screenshot of the output:
