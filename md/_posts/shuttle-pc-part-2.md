<p>I didn&#8217;t read the parts compatibility guide online before buying the RAM and graphics cards so the Shuttle wasn&#8217;t working up until last week. Since I couldn&#8217;t see anything for lack of graphics and I don&#8217;t have another DDR3 compatible machine lying around, I couldn&#8217;t test the parts. Shuttle PCs don&#8217;t beep on POST so I couldn&#8217;t even tell if the motherboard and CPU worked (power and fans worked though). The only way to proceed would be to buy a new compatible graphics card and RAM.</p>

I bought a (much faster) Radeon 5770, which is running perfectly fine on the 300W power supply. I&#8217;ve got a 500W power supply coming in, too, since I&#8217;ve put so much stuff into this little box already, might as well make sure none of it gets fried or dies from insufficient power. I also got two 2GB sticks of Transcend DDR3, which I don&#8217;t need but might was well keep. The G.Skill Ripjaws sticks work fine, so now I&#8217;ve got a whopping total of 12GB in the Shuttle.</p>

Getting that Neil Poulton screwless case apart was a pain in the ass and I almost broke it! There&#8217;s now 300 GB out of 1.25 TB available. Definitely going to have to get a bigger HDD, then I&#8217;ll put the 250GB HDD into the Lacie case. It took some fiddling to figure out which SATA plugs to use&#8230; apparently you can&#8217;t boot from all of the SATA connections (only the first two). I&#8217;m using 3 out of 4 SATA connections now, and I don&#8217;t see where there&#8217;s room to use the last one (eSATA via PCI card?).</p>
